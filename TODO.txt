Some ideas to implement:

 ✔ synchronization per stage
 ✔ stage superseding with milestones
 ✔ timeout
 - retrying
 - basic configuration (e.g. number of retries)
 - manual retrying
 - pluggable providers for notifications (e.g. Slack, email, ...)
 - "unit" testing (with sample pipelineScript - for regression)
 - plugin sanity check at startup (for internally used plugins (such as for milestones) and pluggable providers)
 - ??? (please report a feature proposal or even better a PR :) )
